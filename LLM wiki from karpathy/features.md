# Features

Nav = **5 pinned tabs + a More overflow grid** (v56). `dp.navcfg` items carry `primary` (pinned to bottom bar — **no cap**, user pins however many they want), `hidden`, `noHide` (Log). renderNav() shows ALL pinned non-hidden tabs (no slice/cap) + a synthetic ⋯ More button → `renderMore()` grid of the rest (incl. Settings). Default opening tab = `settings.defaultTab` (device-local), applied via `navigateTo(defaultTab())` at init. All configurable in Settings ▸ Customize ▸ Tabs (📌 pin any number / 🎯 default / drag order / 👁 hide; a soft tip appears past 5 pins but nothing is blocked). Each screen = a `render*()` in the `RENDER` map, filling `#s-<key>`.

| Tab | key | render fn | storage | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Log | today | openToday/renderToday | dp.entries | core fields config-driven (`dp.corecfg`): mood, energy, sleep, deep-work, tasks, reflection, journal + deep-log sections (`dp.deepcfg`) + habit checklist (`dp.habitcfg`) |
| Time | time | openTime/renderTime | dp.timelog, dp.timeacts | 24h stopwatch, tap-to-switch, editable timeline, per-activity totals; writes `timeSummary` to the day's entry |
| Tasks | tasks | renderTasks | dp.tasks | carry-over, colors, drag |
| Notes | notes | renderNotes | dp.notes | drag, colors, voice |

## Customization engine (More ▸ Customize, renderCustom)
Everything is editable and hideable: theme mode (navy/black/light) + accent (6 colors), nav tabs (reorder/rename/hide), core Log fields, deep-log sections/fields (add/rename/hide, incl. tick-list options), habits, time activities, gym exercises + sets + custom groups + the 6-day split. Deep-log: add/rename/hide fields AND **add or delete whole custom sections** (v58, ids `cs*`). `reloadCfg()` rebuilds the live `HABITS`, `TIME_ACTS_ALL`, `DEEP_SECTIONS` from their configs. Hidden items keep their history.

## Onboarding (first run only)
3 steps: welcome (with data-loss note) → pick habits (+ add own) → pick activities (+ add own). Gated by `needsOnboard()` (no data + no `dp.onboarded`). Unpicked items are hidden via the same config flags.

## Alarms & notifications (native shell only, all offline)
- **Reminders** (`dp.reminders`) — daily; mode `alarm` (full-screen) or `notify`.
- **Events** (`dp.events`) — one-time dated, optional alarm.
- **Full-screen alarm** — `FullScreenAlarmPlugin` → `AlarmActivity` over lock screen (siren/vibrate/Dismiss/Snooze).
- **Running-timer notification** (id 770) — shows active activity + Pause/Stop/Resume (`refreshTimerNotif`).
- **2-day inactivity nudge** (id 760) — pre-scheduled, fires even if app never opened (`scheduleInactivityReminder`).
- **Pomodoro** (id 750) and **Timebox** (ids 800-830) end/start alarms.
- PWA fallbacks (no native shell): in-app foreground alarm, `.ics` calendar export, ntfy push.

Motivation and review layer, from `DAYLOG-STRAVA-RESEARCH.md`. Full mapping and the rules
each is bound by: `strava-build.md`.

- **Trophy case** (Stats ▸ Awards) — 60 awards across 9 tiered families, derived on read,
  never revocable, earned dates replayed from history.
- **Your best ever** (Stats ▸ Overview) — top-3 lifetime ladder per benchmark plus
  best-this-year; rows open that day.
- **Share cards** — 5 canvas designs at 4:5 and 9:16, drawn on device. Delivery falls through
  a 4-rung ladder because Android WebView has no Web Share API; the native rung needs the
  next store build.
- **You vs you** — temporal self-comparison over week / month / year, 10 measures, per-metric
  direction, today excluded, honest degradation.
- **Habit cues** — an optional when/where plan per habit, shown on the chip while un-ticked.
- **Weekly streaks** — a week counts at 3 of 7 days; the running week can never break it.
- **Month in review** — a 5-card deck for any month ever logged, no expiry.
- **Custom goals** — 9 measures × 3 timeframes, free, with the remaining gap always visible
  and "Suggest" drawn from the user's own last three periods.
- **Post-activity save** — title, 1–10 perceived effort and a note on any time block over two
  minutes; the block is saved before you are asked.
- **Fresh start** — one landmark note on a Monday, the 1st, or New Year's Day.
- **Health Connect insights** — 4 sensor insights and 13 correlations, every split on the
  user's own median.

Supporting: `tools/deploy.sh` (proves the live URL serves the version), 159 unit tests, and
an eval suite that now measures every Stats sub-tab and all four overlays.
