// Run tests/unit.js headlessly, so the unit suite is something CI can fail on.
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// tests/unit.js holds 439 assertions against the REAL app functions, and nothing ran it. It was
// browser-only ("load index.html, then paste this into the console"), so it was absent from
// tools/deploy.sh and from CI. Two places in this repo stated the opposite as fact — the CI
// workflow said "this app is vanilla JS with no build and no unit tests", and check-release.mjs
// opened with "the app has no unit tests". Both were written in good faith and both were wrong.
//
// A suite nobody runs does not stay correct. When this was first run headlessly it reported SEVEN
// failures, and six of them were the same rot: backupBlob() started returning { data, skipped } in
// v230 — so that a section which cannot be parsed is reported rather than silently dropped — and
// the assertions still expected the old flat shape. The app was right; the tests had aged out of
// date behind a green wall of nothing checking them.
//
// How it works, and what it refuses to fake
// -----------------------------------------
// jsdom loads the real index.html with the real <script src> tags, served from disk through a
// request interceptor under a real https origin. Two earlier approaches were rejected:
//
//   * a stubbed DOM — tests/unit.js asserts document.getElementById('rate-go') EXISTS, so stubs
//     that return a truthy object make tests pass without testing anything.
//   * inlining the scripts into the HTML — that puts app.js's SOURCE into
//     documentElement.innerHTML, and one test scans exactly that for a forbidden string. It
//     failed for a reason that had nothing to do with the app.
//
// fetch() is stubbed to REJECT rather than resolve: a stub that pretends a network call succeeded
// would let a test pass on something that never happened.
