// Every key the app stores must be either backed up or deliberately excluded.
//
// The export/import in Settings is offered inside the wipe flow, so it is the last thing
// standing between the user and losing everything. Twice now it has quietly dropped data:
// v230 found eleven of the user's own choices missing from BACKUP_KEYS, and v231 found
// dp.settings — their name, reminder time and sync URL — still missing after that sweep.
// Both times the app said "Backup restored" and the user had no way to know otherwise.
//
// The rule was written down as prose in a comment, which is why it kept being broken: nothing
// could check a comment. BACKUP_EXCLUDED turns the exclusions into a list, and this script
// holds the two to account. Add a key to neither and the release fails here.
//
// Dynamic writes are the known blind spot: keys written through helpers such as
// flagRow('dp.hapticsOff', ...) never appear as a literal argument to safeSet. Those are
// reported as unmatched entries rather than ignored, so the list cannot rot unnoticed either.
